# DeadbearBot
![Example Image](https://i.imgur.com/p5hxboO.gif)

## What's it do?
Currently, DeadbearBot can:
* Track and display configurable user profiles!
* Award XP, levels, and currency to users automatically!
* Allow users to buy custom roles and submit custom emojis through a configurable shop!
* Preserve popular messages (i.e. ones with lots of reactions) to a "Star Board"!
* Assign or unassign roles, either manually or automatically!
* Set custom greeting and/or leave messages!
* Automatically change a user's roles when connecting to voice channels!
* Allow users to give themselves roles by clicking emoji reactions!
* Set custom messages to be sent when users gain or lose a role!
* Take a message and put it in an nicely-formatted embed!

## What's planned for the future?
The current to-do list can be found in Issues under the "Enhancement" tag. In addition to these, I'd also like to eventually add:
* A deployment system that allows the bot to be easily set up with no fuss (docker maybe?)
* A pre-hosted version of the bot that can simply be invited to a server, no self-hosting required

## How do I use it?
1. Create a bot application through the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/)
2. Under the "Bot" tab, toggle on the "Presence" and "Server Members" intents
3. Invite your bot to your server with administrator privileges
4. Clone this repository, or download and extract the files manually
5. Install Python (v3.8.6 is recommended) and the requirements from requirements.txt
6. In a terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the repo and run `python main.py`
7. When prompted, enter your bot's secret token (found in the "Bot" tab of the Developer Portal, under "Token")
